# CVCORP Placement Training – Python Problem Solving Portfolio

This repository contains all the coding problems I solved during my CVCORP institute placement training.
I organized the solutions topic-wise with clear input constraints, sample outputs, and clean Python code.

## Topics Covered
- Right Angle Patterns
- Triangle Patterns
- Hollow Patterns
- Rhombus Patterns
- Matrix / Grid Patterns
- Numbers Programs (Prime, Armstrong, Fibonacci, Factorial, etc.)
- Series & Conditions (Range-based problems, switch-case style logic)
- Mathematical Methods (GCD, LCM, AP, GP, HP)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python fundamentals (I/O, loops, conditions)
- Nested loops + spacing alignment
- Pattern printing (stars, numbers, alphabets)
- Input validation & edge-case handling (0 / negative / range limits)
- Basic number theory and series logic
- Clean code structure and documentation

## How to Run
Each file is an individual program.

Example:
```bash
python 03_hollow_patterns/hollow_square.py
